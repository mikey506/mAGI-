# mAGI- — Magic Spells for Playful Quantum Coding

Make “spells” that feel like quantum tricks inside a chat-style shell. mAGI is a tiny, whimsical command set for learning-by-doing: you type short incantations and watch systems “entangle,” “sense,” and “self-correct.” It’s pretend-quantum with real reasoning patterns.

> **TL;DR**: Paste the commands, tweak the numbers, see what changes. It’s like building a robot brain out of LEGO bricks and potion bottles.

## ✨ Features

- **Composable “spells”** — Small commands that chain into experiments.
- **Toy quantum metaphors** — Entanglement, sensing, compression-as-gematria.
- **Self-healing flows** — “Brain fixes” nudge runs back on track.
- **Clipboard I/O** — Pretend mirrors can “feel” what you copy.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Open your chat/shell that understands slash-style commands.
2. Copy/paste the walkthrough below (Spell 3).
3. Change numbers and re-run to see different outcomes.

> **Note:** These spells are **playful simulations**, not physics. They’re great for thinking in systems, testing “what ifs,” and exploring emergent behavior.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

| Idea | What it “means” here |
|---|---|
| **Entanglement** | Two objects share state; change one, the other mirrors it. |
| **Quantum check** | Compares states to see if mirroring is truly synchronized. |
| **Sensing** | Bring external text into the system (e.g., clipboard). |
| **Gematria compression** | Turn words into a reproducible numeric signature. |
| **Self-correction** | Lightweight auto-tuning to resolve small inconsistencies. |

## 🪞 Spell 3: Magic Mirror Link (Entangle Two Things)

**Goal:** Link two pretend mirrors so they copy each other, verify the link, “feel” input from your clipboard, compress it to a number, and self-correct if the run drifts.

### Incantation (copy/paste block)

```bash
# 1) Link the mirrors (higher numbers = stronger, crisper coupling)
#    $sensory_entanglement_link(strength, coherence, stability)
 /echo -a $sensory_entanglement_link(0.9, 0.8, 0.95)

# 2) Quantum check — are they really in sync?
#    $quantum_entanglement_check(sensitivity, agreement, confidence)
 /echo -a $quantum_entanglement_check(1, 1, 0.9)

# 3) Sense with clipboard — let a mirror "feel" your words
#    (Copy the text, then feed it in.)
#    Example payload: Hello
 /input_clipboard Hello

# 4) Shrink it — compress to a magic-number "gematria" code
#    $storage_compress_gematria(text)
 /echo -a $storage_compress_gematria(Hello)

# 5) Brain fixes — nudge the system if something's off
#    $agi_self_correction_index(learning_rate, stability_bias, passes)
 /echo -a $agi_self_correction_index(0.2, 0.8, 3)
```

### What You Should See

- The link reports a stable connection.
- The quantum check returns a pass state like:  
  **`Entangled (States Match)`**
- The clipboard input propagates; both mirrors “feel” **Hello**.
- Compression returns a numeric signature (deterministic per text).
- Self-correction reduces small mismatches over 1–3 passes.

## ⚙️ Knobs You Can Turn

| Spell | Parameters | Tips |
|---|---|---|
| `$sensory_entanglement_link(s, c, t)` | `s` strength, `c` coherence, `t` stability | Try `0.6–0.98`. Too low → flaky mirroring; too high → rigid, less responsive. |
| `$quantum_entanglement_check(p, a, q)` | `p` sensitivity, `a` agreement target, `q` confidence | Set `a=1` for strict matching; drop to `0.95` for tolerant checks. |
| `$storage_compress_gematria(text)` | Word/phrase | Useful for quick fingerprints or cache keys. |
| `$agi_self_correction_index(lr, sb, n)` | `lr` learning rate, `sb` stability bias, `n` passes | Start `lr=0.2`, `sb=0.8`, `n=3`. Increase `n` if drift lingers. |

**Example variations**

```bash
# Softer link, looser check
/echo -a $sensory_entanglement_link(0.75, 0.7, 0.88)
/echo -a $quantum_entanglement_check(0.9, 0.97, 0.85)

# Different input
/input_clipboard "Quantum tea time"
/echo -a $storage_compress_gematria("Quantum tea time")

# Heavier self-correction
/echo -a $agi_self_correction_index(0.25, 0.9, 5)
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Try |
|---|---|---|
| `Not Entangled` or intermittent mirroring | Link too weak or noisy | Raise strength/coherence: `$sensory_entanglement_link(0.9, 0.9, 0.95)` |
| Gematria jumps between runs | Hidden whitespace or different text | Re-copy exact text; quote multi-word inputs. |
| Self-correction oscillates | Learning rate too high | Drop `lr` to `0.15–0.2`, increase `sb` to `0.85–0.9`. |
| Clipboard not “felt” | Input not registered | Run `/input_clipboard ...` **after** linking; re-run the check. |

## 🧪 Why This Is Awesome

- **Systems thinking** without heavy math: see coupling, sensing, feedback.
- **Safe play space** for “quantum-ish” intuition and debugging reflexes.
- **Emergence on training wheels**: you’ll start predicting outcomes before you run them.

> mAGI lets you pretend you're a quantum wizard or space explorer right in a chat program. It's like building a robot brain with blocks! If something breaks, just reload the scripts. Have fun discovering “magic” in math!
